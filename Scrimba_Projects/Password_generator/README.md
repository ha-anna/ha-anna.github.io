## Overview

This is my second Solo Project made with JavaScript, adn I have to admit, it is the project that brought me the most fun. The goal of this project was to create a password generator that generates four random passwords when the button is clicked.
Other functions:

- allows the user to choose the length of the password (5-12 characters)
- copy the password when the input is clicked
- informs the user that the password was copied
- informs the user to first click "generate" button if you ty to copy the password when the field is empty

## My process

In this project, I was given a design file which I should follow when creating CSS. I began by analyzing the design and setting up the HTML structure. After that, I wrote the CSS and JavaScript.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned a lot about CSS and HTML structure, and also how to access and manipulate input's values. I also practiced changing CSS styles with JavaScript, add Event Listeners, use `Math.random()`, various string methods and `for` loops.

### Continued development

In the future I'd like to add a function that lets the user choose if they want numbers and special characters to appear in their password or not.
