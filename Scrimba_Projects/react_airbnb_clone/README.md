## My process

I started from setting up my files with Create React App and moved on to plan out components and files. Then I rendered all the HTML with `ReactDOM.render()` and styled it with CSS. I also used props and created a reusable Card component that imports data from a file and maps it into every card, creating a different cards with minimal work.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- React

### What I learned

I learned about props and creating reusable components.

### Continued development

I will be adding more experiences and fixing some minor CSS issues soon.
