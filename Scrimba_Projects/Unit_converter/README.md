## Overview

This is the first Solo Project in which I was using JavaScript. The goal was to create a unit converter, that takes a numerical input and converts it to different values (meters/feet, liters/gallons, kilograms/pounds).

## My process

In this project, I was given a design file which I should follow when creating CSS. I began by analyzing the design and setting up the HTML structure. After that, I wrote the CSS and JavaScript.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to use linear-gradients, use flex box, and create inputs. As for JavaScript, I practiced using `.toFixed()`, functions, Event Listeners and `for... in` loops.

### Continued development

This project's JvaScript code has been already refactored once. I do not plan to work on it more, but I will occasionally return to the code to revise it.
