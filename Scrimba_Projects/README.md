## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Google Fonts
- [Shape Divider App](https://www.shapedivider.app/)

### What I learned

I have learned basics of JavaScript (loops, functions, DOM manipulation, JSON, conditional statements etc) and practiced my CSS and HTML skills.

### Continued development

My goal is to be able to write clean and readable code and to gain a high proficiency in JavaScript to make interactive and well-designed webpages.
