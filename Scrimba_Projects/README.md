## My process

- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I have learned basics of JavaScript (loops, functions, DOM manipulation, JSON, conditional statements etc) and practiced my CSS and HTML skills. 

### Continued development

My goal is to be able to write clean and readable code and to gain a high proficiency in JavaScript to make interactive and well-designed webpages.
