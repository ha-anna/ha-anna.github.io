# Blackjack Game [25 April 2022]

This is the first JavaScript game that I made. The rules are: you have to get 21 points to get Blackjack, otherwise you lose or have to draw another card. It's a game based on luck.

## My process

I began from writing the HTML structure, then moved on to CSS and finally, wrote JavaScript. In JavaScript, I focused on creating functions that will return random numbers between 1 and 12 and then created an if statement that assigns proper points to returned values.
I also added next card button that can only gives another card if the game has begun, the player doesn't have Blackjack yet, and didn't already exceed 21 points.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to use functions and access DOM, as well as how to add Event Listeners.

### Continued development

I want to become more comfortable using JavaScript and build more complex games. In the future, I plan to revisit this code, refactor it and add more functionality.
