### What I learned

I learned how to create and deploy a Chrome extension, use various APIs, create a working clock, and get current location from the user.

### Continued development

I plan to personalize this extension in a near future. I want to add a function to add todos and exchange bitcoin part of the extension with something more my style, such as geek jokes or interesting facts.
