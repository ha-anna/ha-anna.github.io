## My process

This project was made step by step by completing challenges from the teacher. I decided to use SASS instead of CSS to practice what I've learned the day before. I started by creating HTML structure, writing SASS and then working on JavaScript.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- API: [Deck Of Cards](https://deckofcardsapi.com/)
- [Transparent Textures](https://www.transparenttextures.com/)

### What I learned

With this project I practiced using APIs, writing async/await functions and applying logic to make the game work as intended.

### Continued development

After some time, I will refactor this code and possibly add more features to make it more interesting.
