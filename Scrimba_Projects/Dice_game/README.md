# Dice Game [8 May 2022]

This is a game in which the player who first gets 21 points or more, wins. This project was a part of my learning path where I focused on understanding and applying JavaScript.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I developed my design skills when working on this project's CSS. As for JavaScript, I learned more about `classList`, how to manipulate DOM, add and change CSS styles and add animation when firing an event.

### Continued development

In the future I will revisit this code to refactor it and add additional functionality: I plan to make the game more fair so that Player 2 can also begin the game.
