### Links

- Live Site URL: [Emoji Tool](https://its-haanna.github.io/Scrimba_Projects/Emoji_tool/)

## My process

I began by creating the HTML structure, choosing fonts, colors and design and implementing it with CSS. Then, I wrote JavaScript that allows the user to add and remove emoji to the beginning or the end of the line. I used Noto's emoji font and SVG made by Shape Divider App.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I practiced using `.unshift()`, `.shift()`, `.pop()` and `.push()`, adding Event Listeners and manipulating DOM.

### Continued development

In the future, I will try refactoring this code to make it even more readable and human-friendly.
