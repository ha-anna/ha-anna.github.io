# Responsive Page: BBQ Webinar [16 May 2022]

This project is a part of Scrimba's Responsive Design Module. I made the entire page by looking at high-fidelity wireframes and then build upon the design by choosing hover effects, and coding JavaScript code on my own.

## My process

I started from analyzing the wireframes to create an appropriate HTML structure, then moved on to add basic styling. I took a mobile-first approach and upon setting it I moved on to bigger sizes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to apply mobile-first approach and various CSS styles. It was my first time applying gradient to a border, but after reading a tutorial on how to achieve it, I accomplished it without any issues.

### Continued development

I plan take mobile-first approach in most of my future projects. I will also learn more about `FormData()` to use it more efficiently when creating forms.
