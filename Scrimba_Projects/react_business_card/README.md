## Overview

This was my first solo React project after starting to learn React. The goal was to create a static site based on the figma design that was provided.

## My process

I started from setting up my files with Create React App and moved on to plan out components and files. Then I rendered all the HTML with `ReactDOM.render()` and styled it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- React

### What I learned

I learned the basics of React: what JSX is, how to create and organise components, import and export things between files (although I already knew how to do that in JS), how to style my HTML with className, and how to set up my projects locally!

### Continued development

I will keep learning React to create reusable, interactive apps.
