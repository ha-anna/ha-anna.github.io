## My process

First, I started by tweaking HTMl and creating a design that I like with CSS. Then I began working on JavaScript.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to manipulate DOM and use `.slice()` and `.charAt()`.

### Continued development

I intend to keep expanding my JavaScript and front-end knowledge. In the future, I would like to expand it and build a project in which not only single word but entire sentences are fixed.
