## Overview

The goal was to filter out all duplicate emoji, leaving only one of each emoji and render them in the filed below. I also completed the stretch goal to sort all the emoji by type and render them.

## My process

First, I started by tweaking HTMl and creating a design that I like with CSS. Then I began working on JavaScript.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

Through this challenge, I practiced using `...` spread operator, `.join()` an `.sort()`.

### Continued development

My goal is to complete all the Scrimba Challenge Week Projects and have a strong understanding of JavaScript.
