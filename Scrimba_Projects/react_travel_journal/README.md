## Overview

This was my second React solo project. The goal was to create a travel journal app that renders cards from imported data and displays them on the page. This project is supposed to be done alone from the scratch.

## My process

I started from setting up my files with Create React App and moved on to plan out components and files. I created a card component and my own data file. Then I used props to map the data into every card. Then I rendered all the HTML with `ReactDOM.render()` and styled it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- React

### What I learned

I have practiced using props, creating reusable components, and using React. I also got to play around with media queries and CSS, which allowed me to personalize the page and make it responsive.

### Continued development

As I travel I will try adding more locations and maybe think of adding additional props.
