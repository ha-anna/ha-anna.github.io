## Overview

With this project, the goal was to practice using `useState()`, `props`, and `useEffect()`.

### Features

- rolling randomized dice
- holding dice from being rolled
- starting new game when certain conditions are met

## My process

First, I started from setting up my project, and writing HTML and CSS. Next, I worked on adding functionality (randomizing dice values, rolling the numbers, holding the dice from rolling, confetti, etc). Finally, I checked the design looks cross-browser, added normalize.css and improved CSS.

### Built with

- CSS
- React
- npm (normalize.css, react-confetti)

### What I learned

I became more comfortable using `useEffect()`, understanding how to set state, and just thinking in terms of how to separate functionality and make my code cleaner.

### Continued development

I will be adding additional functionality:

1. putting real dots on the dice (CSS)
2. tracking number of rolls
3. tracking the tme it took to win
4. saving your best time to localStorage
