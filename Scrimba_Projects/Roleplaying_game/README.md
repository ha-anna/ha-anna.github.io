This is a role-playing game in which you, Wizard of Cats, are up against great villains: Captain Cat, Wild West Catboy, and Cleopawtra. Each roll of the dice equals the damage received and given. Try your best to be victorious.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

Through this project, I gained a better understanding of `.map()`, `Class`, `setTimeout()`, and `.fill()`. I was also able to use my design skills and CSS skills to make the hero and monster cards resemble trading cards from my childhood.

### Continued development

I want to become more comfortable using JS Classes and modules. Moreover, I want to work further on the animation when a new character appears so that the transition is smooth and seamless.
